# Phoenix
Phoenix is a python program made for pen-testers. Capable of many features, it can be used for information gathering, vulnerability analysis, and many more. I'll be also adding many more features that will make your life easier. This is a long term project so don't expect much right now. This is for educational purposes only and we're not responsible for any illegal action(s) caused/taken by our users. You may use this program for penetration testing only.
